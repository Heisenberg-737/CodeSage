# CodeSage :heart:

# Goal
Significant reduction of coding and debugging time for developers, with the help of an  in-built editor and compile, that helps the developer to do the following:

* Understand existing codebases.<br/>
* Debug their code.<br/>
* Optimise the code.<br/>
* Scale the system.<br/>
* Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.<br/>
* Judge the quality and complexity of the code.<br/>


# Business Model
Despite the ongoing recession, the software industry is expected to grow by 31% globally in the coming years. This growth is accompanied by a significant number of aspiring developers aiming to secure positions in top tech companies. Here are some key metrics that highlight the scope and magnitude of the software industry:

### Market Size: 
The global software market is projected to reach a value of $1.43 trillion by 2022, with steady growth expected in the coming years.
Employment: The software industry is a significant source of jobs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 1.6 million software developers were employed in the United States alone in 2020, with a projected growth rate of 22% from 2019 to 2029.

### Contribution to GDP: 
The software industry contributes significantly to the economies of many countries. In the United States, software and related services contributed over $1.6 trillion to the GDP in 2020, accounting for around 8% of the total GDP.

### Venture Capital Investment: 
The software industry attracts substantial venture capital investment globally. In 2020, global venture capital funding for software companies amounted to approximately $69 billion, indicating the industry's potential for innovation and growth.

The different segments that CodeSage would target are as follows:


### 1. Big tech firms: 
Codesage can provide significant benefits to big tech firms like FAANG. With large codebases and hugely complex systems, these firms can benefit from features such as code output visibility, error detection, and optimization suggestions. These tools can help teams identify and resolve issues quickly, reducing debugging time and improving overall productivity. Additionally, CodeSage can assist in scaling code by providing insights into performance bottlenecks and offering suggestions for code optimization. The ability to detect vulnerabilities can also help enhance the security of their software systems.
 
### 2. Startups with less manpower for coding: 
Startups often have limited resources and smaller teams, making efficient coding practices crucial for their success. CodeSage can be a valuable asset for startups with limited manpower for coding. By providing code output visibility and error detection, CodeSage will help identify and fix issues promptly, saving time and effort. Moreover, it can suggest optimizations to improve code efficiency and scalability, enabling startups to build robust and scalable software systems with fewer resources.

### 3. Coding Schools:
  With more and more developers trying to ace their interviews by taking up coding courses or enrolling themselves in coding classes, the best of the classes would be those that provide instant feedback to ace their learning. CodeSage can offer real-time code output and error feedback, allowing instructors to provide immediate guidance and support to students. By highlighting errors and suggesting improvements, CodeSage can help students understand coding concepts more effectively and develop good programming practices. Moreover, features like code optimization suggestions can teach students how to write efficient code.


# Problems with the existing solutions
While editors that offer AI assistance to code have brought significant advancements to the development process, they still face certain challenges and limitations. Some problems with existing AI-assisted code editors include:

* Accuracy and Reliability: AI models used in code editors may not always provide accurate suggestions or predictions. The quality of AI assistance heavily relies on the training data and the model's understanding of coding concepts. Inaccurate suggestions can lead to code errors or inefficiencies if blindly followed by developers.
* Limited Context Awareness: AI models in code editors often lack a deep understanding of the overall project or the developer's specific intent. They may struggle to grasp the broader context in which the code is being written


* Lack of Specificity: The answers provided by AI Chatbots are often generic and may not address the specific use case or problem at hand. Tailoring the responses to meet the specific requirements of interview preparation can be a limitation.


* Context Dependency: Each time the user wants to utilize the AI Chatbot for interview preparation or debugging or optimizing, they need to provide the context. This requirement to repeatedly mention the context can be cumbersome and time-consuming.


* Copy-pasting Inefficiency: Coding in a different editor, and coming to a different place to debug it or ask for assistance isn't the most optimal way for a firm. Having a smart editor with in-built compiler that can solve all your needs would be extremely time efficient.


* Potential Distractions: AI Chatbots may divert the user's attention away from the code-editor, leading to distractions. The need to switch between different interfaces or platforms can disrupt the focus and flow of the preparation session.
